        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This cream sauce for pasta made with Italian-style diced tomatoes is absolutely delicious. <br>
                It's rich, creamy, and so easy to make! Serve this foolproof sauce over your favorite pasta.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Onion and Garlic</strong><br>
                    You'll start this cream sauce for pasta by sauteing garlic and diced onions in olive oil <br>until they're translucent and fragrant.</li>
                <li><strong>Canned tomatoes</strong><br>
                    This convenient cream sauce recipe calls for a can of Italian-style diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. <br>
                    Don't drain the can, as the juices are necessary for the perfect consistency and flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings</strong><br>
                    Dried basil leaves, white sugar, dried oregano, salt, and ground black pepper add a <br>complex savory flavor (with just a touch of sweetness).</li>
                <li><strong>Heavy Cream</strong><br>
                    You can't make cream sauce for pasta without cream! For a slightly lighter twist, try using half milk and half heavy cream.</li>
                <li><strong>Butter</strong><br>
                    Just a tablespoon of butter ensures a rich, velvety smooth finish.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook onions over medium-heat in olive oil until translucent, then stir in garlic.</li>
                <li>Add tomatoes, basil, sugar, oregano, salt, and pepper. Boil until the tomatoes have cooked down <br>and most of the ingredients have evaporated.</li>
                <li>Remove the pan from heat, then stir in cream and butter. Return to the stove and simmer for about 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
